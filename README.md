# Mudlet April Fool 2020 Content Filter Code Bot

This simple bot was part of the Mudlet April Fool 2020 joke. Release 4.7 of the project supposedly contained a content filter that could be disabled by supplying a special code.

The code was generated by this bot by MD5-hashing the user name requesting a code with the command `!code I am over 18 years old`.

Additional features include a `!stats` command to get an overview how much the bot was used and an `!export` command to export generated codes and how often each user requested their code.

The `export` feature was supposed to lead to open up another activity but since the bot was restarted during or after 1st April (due to the hoster's policy) and the bot having no persistance layer,
all statistical data has been lost.
